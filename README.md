# Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and data for a churn prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you'll need to have Python 3.10 or later installed on your machine. You'll also need to install several Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The main dataset used for this project is `ibm_telco_customer_churn.csv`. This dataset contains customer information and whether or not they churned.

## Code

The main notebook is `models.ipynb`, which trains and evaluates machine learning models for churn prediction.

## Results

The main results are in the form of a Jupyter notebook, `exploration.ipynb`, which contains code, visualizations, and analysis of the project results.
